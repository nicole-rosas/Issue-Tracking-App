# Issue-Tracking-App
Final project for CS3520 *Programming in C++* <br /> with classmate

<br />System mimics *Jira* a project management software with a simple user interface using the command line.
<br />User can create a project which includes users who can be project leads or team members, add issues that can be grouped into sprints, and simulate time passing for sprints to be finished and issues be completed. User operates the system typing in commands from the menu offered in the command line.

<br />Note: When asked to type in username, an issue, or sprint enter in a one word string with no new line or space.<br /> 
When first running the program, system will ask if you wish to load a project or make a new project. Because this will be the first time running, type in 2 to create a new project. 
<br />The system will then ask for user to enter in a userId, this can be any single-worded id with no newline or space in the id. 
<br />Then the user will be prompted by system to enter in the name of a project. This can also be a single word. 
<br />After doing this, the user will become the owner of the project they have just created. 
<br />Now, the user will be given options for the system to perform.
<br />As they are the project lead there are specific commands they will see. Type any menu choice for the system to load the commands.
<br /><br />
If there has already been a project made, then you will be asked if you are a returning user. Enter in the userId and if the username exists, then you will be prompted with specific choices depending on who you are.
